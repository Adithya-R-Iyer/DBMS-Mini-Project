# DBMS-Mini-Project
This is a 'Student Academic Assessment System' which is build completely using Java with MySQL database Support.
This is just a Mini-Project which i build for my Academic Requirement.
This `academic assessment system` can handle the entire student database starting from his personal information to his/her academic records.
It contains the details of all the students including the Faculty working in the respective College.
The Database is designed to handle all the Student and Faculty Records of a College right from the Beginning.
The front-end is designed using JAVA SWINGS which provides a user-friendly API that makes it easy to navigate through... for anyone using the System 
It handles all the information starting from internal marks to attendance and provides a user-friendly experience to the Faculty in manipulating the student database.

There are 3 Views of the database
-> Admin View :- Admin has powers to manipulate the Student and Faculty Information... add/remove them, update their details etc...
-> Student View :- Each Student has a unique login and he/she can view his/her performance in the current semester inculding those in the previous semesters..
-> Faculty View :- Each Faculty has a unique login and can access his/her classes for the current semester various student records and they also have the provision to
                   take the attendance, in which case.. all the records would be updated then and there itself.
                   Apart from this they can easily navigate and find out the Eligible Students including those who have failed.
                   
Also Students are provided with an option to give the feedback to their respective faculties for the current semester ...and this feedback from each student will be
reflected in their(faculty's) personnal profile.
